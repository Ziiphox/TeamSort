# TeamSort
Team sorting discord bot written in python.

note to self: don't fucking --force unless you know exactly what you're fucking.

In order for the bot to work you need to make a folder called "data" and a config.json file inside which contains info for the bot.\nExample:
```
{
  "token": "PUT BOT TOKEN HERE",
  "default_prefix": "!",
  "bot_name": "TeamSort"
}
```
